## Operational data (use case specific)
    1. GRID3 public
    2. GRID3 internal
    3. Data sharing standards


## Ancillary data (semi-standardized)
    1. OSM , other

## Labeling schemes
    1. Expressions
    2. Fonts and variable weights
    3. Leader lines and offset defaults
    4. Feature weights / priorities
    5. Label classes* (TBD)
    6. Abbreviation dictionaries

## Foreground / background separation 
    1. Queries
        1. Tabular: page query setup
        2. Geometric: Feature-level mask sources: the mask-ing and mask-ed
    2. “Mask” components and transparency
    3. A note on raster effects and rasterization of outputs (see also: export best practices)
    4. Contrast: Figure vs ground

## Scale dependency
    1. Symbology levels (classed)
    2. Visibility (binary)

## Small scale generalization toolset
    1. Aggregation
    2. Polygon / line simplification* (TBD)

## Data storage best practices (see mkDir)
